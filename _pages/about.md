I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the CSE department at [UC San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu), advised by [Prof. Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/).
My research interests cover computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning and AR/VR.

During the summer of 2019, I was an intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), working with [Yannick Hold-Geoffroy](http://yannickhold.com/), [Qi Sun](https://qisun.me/), [Stephen DiVerdi](http://www.stephendiverdi.com/) and [Kalyan Sunkavalli](http://www.kalyans.org/). And in the summer of 2020, I interned at [Facebook Reality Labs Research](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/), working with [Lei Xiao](https://leixiao-ubc.github.io/) and [Feng Liu](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~fliu/).

Previously, I completed my undergraduate in [electrical engineering](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw) at [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw), where I worked with [Prof. Homer H. Chen](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/bio1.php?teacher_id=60) on augmented reality.
